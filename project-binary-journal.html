            <h1>The Binary Journal</h1>
            <p>
                An opinion-driven technology publication built from scratch to analyze
                emerging products, trends, and events with clarity, structure, and
                original perspective.

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                The Binary Journal was created as a platform for thoughtful analysis
                in the technology space. Rather than summarizing news or press releases,
                the goal was to provide structured opinions and deeper reasoning about
                how new technologies impact users, developers, and society.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Problem -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Much of existing tech coverage prioritizes speed over insight, resulting
                in repetitive reporting with little original analysis. This makes it
                difficult for readers to understand the broader implications of new
                products or trends beyond surface-level announcements.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Solution -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
                I designed and developed a custom website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                with a strong emphasis on readability, content hierarchy, and navigation.
                The platform was intentionally built without templates to allow full
                control over layout and iteration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Articles are structured to present clear arguments rather than summaries,
                allowing the site to function as a journal of analysis instead of a news
                feed. SEO was implemented to ensure discoverability while maintaining
                content quality.
            </p>

        <!-- Outcome -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>
                The Binary Journal has reached readers in over 70 countries through
                organic search, demonstrating effective SEO implementation and content
                structure. The site continues to evolve as new articles and features
                are added.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project demonstrates my ability to combine technical execution,
                structured writing, and long-term maintenance to build a platform that
                communicates ideas clearly and consistently.
