            <p>
                I am a student developer focused on building systems that remove friction,
                scale effectively, and hold up under real-world use. I’m most interested
                in problems where clarity, reliability, and long-term impact matter more
                than surface-level complexity.
            </p>

            <p>
                My work sits at the intersection of technology, operations, and design.
                I’ve built AI-assisted tools, internal dashboards, and production websites
                for real users, with an emphasis on making systems easier to understand,
                maintain, and improve over time.
            </p>

            <p>
                I approach projects by identifying bottlenecks, defining constraints early,
                and iterating toward simple solutions that scale. I value documentation,
                feedback, and ownership, and I work best in environments that trust contributors
                with meaningful responsibility.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m especially drawn to work involving accessibility, analytical tooling,
                and human-centered applications of AI — areas where thoughtful system design
                can materially improve how people interact with the world.
