            <h1>PathAble</h1>
            <p>
                An AI-assisted accessibility application designed to help people with
                disabilities navigate physical environments by identifying obstacles
                and ADA-related features in real time.

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                PathAble was developed as a submission for the 2025 Congressional App Challenge.
                The project focuses on accessibility and mobility, addressing challenges faced
                by individuals with disabilities when navigating public and private spaces.
            </p>

        <!-- Problem -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Many navigation tools assume ideal conditions and fail to account for
                accessibility barriers such as stairs, broken ramps, missing guardrails,
                or inaccessible entrances. For users with mobility impairments, this
                lack of information can significantly limit independence and safety.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Solution -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
                I built an application that combines mapping, crowdsourced data, and
                AI-based image recognition to identify accessibility features and
                obstacles such as stairs, escalators, and ramps.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system uses machine learning models to detect ADA-related objects
                and integrates this information into an intuitive interface that
                provides heads-up navigation assistance.

            <h2>Outcome & Impact</h2>
            <p>
                PathAble demonstrates how AI can be applied to real-world accessibility
                challenges in a practical and user-centered way. The project emphasizes
                ethical design, usability, and meaningful impact rather than novelty.
