                A custom-built photography portfolio designed, developed, and maintained
                end-to-end to showcase work across multiple disciplines with clarity
                and strong user experience.

        <!-- Context -->

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                This project serves as both a professional portfolio and a long-term,
                actively maintained platform for my photography work. Unlike template-based
                galleries, the site was built from scratch to give full control over layout,
                performance, and presentation.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Problem -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Many photography portfolios rely on rigid templates that limit customization,
                slow down iteration, and obscure the work itself with unnecessary visual noise.
                I wanted a platform that prioritized usability, fast navigation, and intentional
                presentation while remaining easy to update over time.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Solution -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
                I designed and developed a lightweight, custom website using HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript. The site emphasizes clean structure, intuitive navigation,
                and consistent visual hierarchy so that the photography remains the focus.
            </p>
            <p>
                All photos were shot and edited by me, and the site is continuously updated
                as new work is produced. The codebase is simple and maintainable, allowing
                for fast iteration without reliance on third-party builders.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Outcome -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>
                The result is a flexible, professional portfolio that supports multiple
                photography styles including automotive, nature, and event photography.
                The site demonstrates long-term ownership, attention to detail, and a
                strong understanding of how users interact with visual content.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project also reinforces how visual thinking informs my work in web
                design and systems building, particularly around layout, clarity, and
                user experience.
